Behavioral Pattern Predictor (BPP). BPP exploits the fact that our daily routines on the Web can be used to identify us. Given sufficient training data, BPP predicts user behavior, detects abnormal user behavior, and even tries to identify known users by their behavioral pattern across different networks (e.g. Tor).
